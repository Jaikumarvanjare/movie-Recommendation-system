üé¨ Movie Recommender System
A simple and intuitive movie recommendation system built with Streamlit. This application helps users discover new movies based on their interests by suggesting films similar to one they've selected.

Live Demo: https://movie-recommendation-system-gzi2prtm5gxqq5hjnthstd.streamlit.app/

‚ú® Features
User-friendly Interface: A clean and simple UI for easy navigation.

Vast Movie Selection: Choose from a large database of movies.

Instant Recommendations: Get a list of 5 similar movies instantly.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommendations are generated based on movie tags, genres, cast, and director to find stylistically similar films.

üß† How It Works
This recommendation system uses a content-based filtering approach. Here's a simplified breakdown of the logic:

Data Collection: The model is trained on a movie dataset that includes details like genres, keywords, cast, and crew for each film.

Feature Engineering: Relevant text-based features (like cast, director, and genres) are combined into a single "tags" string for each movie.

Vectorization: The "tags" for all movies are converted into numerical vectors using a technique called TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This allows us to represent each movie as a point in a multi-dimensional space.

Similarity Calculation: The cosine similarity is calculated between the vector of the user's selected movie and the vectors of all other movies. A higher cosine similarity score means the movies are more alike in content.

Recommendation: The top 5 movies with the highest similarity scores are returned as the recommendations.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Streamlit: For building and deploying the interactive web application.

Pandas: For data manipulation and processing.

Scikit-learn: For implementing TF-IDF vectorization and calculating cosine similarity.

TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset: The dataset used to power the recommendations.
